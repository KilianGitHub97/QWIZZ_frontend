# Large Language Models for Analysis of Qualitative Data in Research (Frontend)
This project, developed as a master's project under the guidance of Dr. Mateusz Dolata, holds a web application where users can chat with their own interview data. The user interface is built with React and TypeScript. The frontend utilizes the React Query library to manage global states and make REST API calls.

## Introduction
Welcome to Qwizz! ðŸš€

Qwizz, short for "Q" for qualitative interview data and "wizz" as a reference to its chatbot functionality, is the brainchild of Richard Specker, Ivelin Ivanov, and Kilian Sennrich, three master students from the University of Zurich (UZH). With guidance from Dr. Mateusz Dolata of the Department of Informatics - Information Management Research Group, we've developed this user-friendly web application to address the challenges faced by researchers when handling large volumes of qualitative interview data.

Over a series of interviews (reqirement engineering), we've learnt about the struggle of sifting through a mountain of interviews (sometimes more than 50!), trying to extract meaningful insights. Qwizz steps in to assist with this daunting task! It doesn't automate the entire analysis process, but rather acts as your trusty companion, guiding you through your interviews, helping you find your information quickly, and inspiring new ideas.

Qwizz simplifies the process of interacting with your interview data through a chatbot interface. It extracts and presents relevant content to you, allows you to explore relevant interview passages, and ultimately empowers you to make the most of your research journey.

Give Qwizz a try, and let it be your partner in the exploration and understanding of your interview data. Click [here](https://qwizz-frontend.ivelin.info/) to get started. Happy researching! ðŸ“šðŸ’¡

## Installation

Follow these installation steps:

**Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the Qwizz frontend repository to your local machine. In your terminal, execute the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/LLM-for-Qualitative-Data-Analysis/frontend
```

**Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the Qwizz-frontend folder:
```shell
cd your/local/qwizz/directory
```

**Install JavaScript Dependencies**: Make sure that you have the latest node.js and npm verisons. Next, install the necessary dependencies using npm:

## Technology
The following technologies are used within the frontend:
- **Deployment**: The frontend is deployed on Heroku.
- **Web Server**: We used Nginx as the web server.
- **Framework**: The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, providing a robust and efficient development environment.
- **Global State Management**: We managed global states with React Query, making it easy to fetch and cache data.
- **Styling**: For UI and styling, we utilized Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and react-icons-kit to create a modern and responsive user interface.
- **API Communication**: For REST API communication, we used React Axios within React Query, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.
